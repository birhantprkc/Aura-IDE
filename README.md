**A desktop coding agent with a phone-side command center.**

Aura works on real repos from a desktop cockpit. It plans changes, edits files through reviewable diffs, validates work, leaves receipts, and can be steered from your phone. Open source. Local-first. You control the keys, the model, and the workflow.

## The core idea

**AI coding agents need receipts, not vibes.**

Most AI coding tools are black boxes — they edit files directly with no intermediate reasoning, no diff review, and no validation. You cross your fingers and hope the output is correct.

Aura works differently. Every change is visible, reviewable, and verifiable.

- **Planner** reads your workspace and writes a structured spec before any code is touched. You see the plan, you approve it.
- **Worker** executes from that spec through controlled file tools. Every proposed edit shows as a unified diff. Approve or reject before anything touches disk.
- **Validation** runs after every change. If something breaks, the Worker inspects the error and retries. If recovery fails, the change is aborted cleanly — no broken state.
- **Receipts** show every tool call, token cost, and file changed. You know exactly what happened and what it cost.

This is not a chat wrapper. This is a two-agent harness with guardrails, visibility, and accountability.

## See the workflow

Watch the full loop: the Planner reads your repo, writes a spec, the Worker edits files, validates, and completes.

  <img src="media/workflow-complete.png" alt="Aura workflow complete" width="420">
</p>

**Plan → Dispatch → Work → Review → Complete.** Five steps, one loop. You see every stage, approve every write, and get a receipt when it's done.

## Quick start

**Windows:** Download the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/CarpseDeam/Aura-IDE/releases). Per-user install, no admin rights needed. In-app updates handled automatically.

**From source (all platforms):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarpseDeam/Aura-IDE.git
cd Aura-IDE
pip install .
aura
```

**First run:**
1. Open a workspace (File → Open Workspace).
2. Choose your model path:
   - **Aura Credits** — click the Credits status pill in the toolbar to open the standalone Credits popout. Buy credits ($5, $10, $20, $50 packs) and select Aura as your Planner or Worker provider. No API keys needed.
   - **BYOK** — open Settings → API Keys and add your key for DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenRouter.
3. Ask for something small — "fix a typo in README.md" or "add a docstring to this function."
4. Review the Planner's spec, then click dispatch.
5. Approve or reject each diff the Worker proposes.
6. Watch validation run. Review the receipt.

## What's new in v1.9.8

- **Polished standalone Aura Credits popout** — Credits live in their own clean window. Buy packs, check balance, see session cost — all from one place.
- **Aura Credits status-bar pill** — Your balance and session spend are visible at a glance in the toolbar. Click to open the full Credits popout.
- **More precise session cost display** — Token counts and cost estimates are sharper across both Planner and Worker roles.
- **Companion can create new chat threads from phone** — Start a fresh conversation right from your mobile browser. The desktop picks it up instantly.
- **Duplicate New Chat button fixed** — Empty projects no longer show a redundant button on mobile.
- **Compact New Chat shortcut** — A quick-access control in the mobile chat header so you can start a thread without navigating away.
- **Worker Flow anti-thrash guard** — The Worker now detects and breaks out of repetitive recovery loops, reducing wasted tokens on unrecoverable validation failures.

## Aura Companion

Aura Companion turns your phone into a remote command center for your desktop agent. It's a web surface — no app store, no install.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/phone-home.jpg" alt="Aura Companion home on phone" width="260">
  <img src="media/proj-phone-home.jpg" alt="Aura Companion projects on phone" width="260">
</p>

**Pair your phone in seconds.** Enable Companion from the desktop, scan the QR code or enter the pairing ticket on your phone browser, and you're connected. Communication flows through the relay — your phone never needs to be on the same network as your desktop.

**What you can do from your phone:**
- Browse your projects and conversation threads
- Start a new chat — the desktop picks it up and the Planner responds
- Send messages to your Planner mid-conversation
- Dispatch specs so the Worker runs on your desktop
- Watch execution stream live as it happens
- Check drone status and review run receipts

The Companion is a remote control, not a separate IDE. Your desktop does the work. Your phone gives you access when you're away from the keyboard.

## Aura Credits, telemetry, and BYOK

Aura gives you two paths to model access. Choose what fits you.

### Aura Credits — the easiest way to start

Credits are a pay-as-you-go balance that works across all Aura-hosted models. No API keys. No provider accounts. No configuration.

- Open the Credits popout from the toolbar status pill
- Buy a pack ($5, $10, $20, $50)
- Select "Aura" as your Planner or Worker provider
- Start building

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/cache-hit.png" alt="Aura cache and status telemetry" width="700">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/token-cost.png" alt="Aura token cost and session telemetry" width="650">
</p>

Credits include a small service margin to help cover hosting, the relay, and infrastructure. You always see your balance and session spend in the status bar.

### Bring Your Own Keys — full provider freedom

Connect directly to the model provider of your choice. Your key, your billing, your data.

Supported providers: **DeepSeek**, **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Gemini**, **OpenRouter**

Set your API key in Settings → API Keys. Keys are encrypted to disk with a hardware-derived key. Environment variables also work (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.).

**Mix and match.** Use Aura Credits for the Planner and your own Anthropic key for the Worker. Or the reverse. Both paths support the full Planner/Worker architecture.

---

## Why Aura is different

Most AI coding tools edit files directly with no intermediate reasoning layer. Aura separates concerns and puts you in control.

- **Planner/Worker separation** — two agents, two roles, no confusion. One researches and specs, the other builds and validates.
- **Repo-aware context** — AST repo maps, dependency graphs, BM25 code search, all baked into every Planner prompt. Aura understands your project structure, not just your last message.
- **Diff approval** — every proposed write shows a unified diff before touching disk. Approve, reject, approve all, or reject all.
- **Validation and recovery** — every change is validated. The Worker retries on failure and aborts cleanly if recovery fails. No broken state.
- **Receipts** — tool calls, token costs, files changed. Every run produces a record you can inspect.
- **Provider flexibility** — swap models per role. Cheap planner, capable worker. DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, or Aura Credits.
- **Local-first control surface** — your desktop runs everything. Your keys, your workspace, your data.

---

## Safety and control

Aura treats AI-generated changes like a teammate's pull request. Every change is visible, reversible, and understandable.

- **Diff approval on every write** — every `write_file`, `edit_file`, or `edit_symbol` shows a unified diff before touching disk. Approve, reject, approve all, or reject all.
- **Automatic backups** — existing files are backed up to `.aura/backups/` before any edit.
- **Read-only mode** — prevents all writes at the tool-registry level. The AI cannot even see write tools. Safe for exploration.
- **Validation and recovery** — every change is validated. The Worker retries on failure and aborts cleanly if recovery fails. No broken state left behind.
- **Git safety net** — snapshot/restore for experimental checkpoints, `/undo` to soft-reset the last commit, auto-generated commit messages.
- **Encrypted API keys** — stored with a hardware-derived Fernet key, not plaintext. Environment variables also supported.

## Drones

Drones are reusable automation cards for repeatable repo work. Define a task once, run it anytime.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/drone-workbay.png" alt="Aura Drone workbay" width="900">
</p>

Each Drone lives in its own folder with a `drone.json` manifest. Drones appear as cards in Aura's Drone panel, where you can run them, loop them on a timer, or delete them. Every run produces a receipt saved to `.aura/drones/runs/`.

**Two kinds of Drones:**

- **Command Drones** — run a local entrypoint through JSON-stdio. Any language works as long as it reads stdin and writes JSON to stdout. Great for small utility tasks.
- **Harness-lap Drones** — run through Aura's full Planner/Worker loop with guardrails: clean worktree, protected paths, max changed files, rollback on failure. Each lap is one bounded pass.

**Write policies** control what a Drone can do: `read_only` (analysis only), `normal_diff_approval` (changes through the same diff-approval cycle as any Worker), or `ask_before_writes` (per-action approval).

Read-only Drones can run in parallel (up to 3). Write-capable Drones use a shared write lane and run one at a time.

---

## Advanced capabilities

- **AST repo map** — structural workspace map from Python AST parsing, included in every Planner system prompt.
- **Dependency graph** — import-tree traversal for blast radius analysis. Know what breaks before you change it.
- **BM25 codebase search** — full-text semantic search across 30+ file extensions and up to 1,500 files.
- **Run-and-watch verification** — the Worker can start a process, observe its output over a configurable window, and classify the result.
- **Git integration** — status, diff, commit, undo, snapshot/restore, automatic `.gitignore` setup.
- **Web research** — built-in sub-agent for live web lookups during planning.
- **MCP tool integration** — connect custom stdio MCP servers. Tools are auto-converted to OpenAI-compatible function schemas.
- **Self-updater** — Windows builds check for updates and install in-place. Git-based updates for source installs.

## Built with Aura

Aura wrote most of itself. During May/June 2026 it processed **2+ billion DeepSeek tokens** across nearly **30,000 API requests** while building its own codebase.

<p align="center">

The harness produces the quality, not the model. Swap models, swap providers, change thinking depth — the workflow stays the same and the output stays consistent.
