# Drones

Drones are reusable folder-backed workers. A Drone is registered from a folder
that contains:

- `drone.json` (the manifest)
- an entrypoint program (e.g. `main.py`)
- optional support files such as `requirements.txt` and `README.md`

Drones declare a command entrypoint in their manifest. Aura launches the
command, sends JSON payload on stdin, and reads JSON cargo from stdout.
Any language that accepts JSON on stdin and returns JSON on stdout works
with a simple command change. `route`, `input_contract`, and
`cargo_contract` are optional but recommended for new Drones. Existing Drones
without them still work.

`allowed_tools` is a compatibility field for older UI surfaces. New Drones run
through their folder entrypoint, not through an LLM tool menu.

Use `/drone` to enter Drone Architect mode, then describe the Drone you want in
the next normal chat message. Aura may use the Planner/Worker harness to author
the folder, but registration goes through `register_drone_folder`, which
validates the folder structure (drone.json must parse, entrypoint files must exist)
before copying the Drone into Aura's global directory. Real Drone behavior is
checked when the user runs the Drone from Workbay.
