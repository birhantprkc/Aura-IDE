"""Tool registry — workspace-jailed dispatch and OpenAI tool definitions.

The registry is the only place that:
- builds the API tool list (mode + read_only swap which tools are exposed)
- resolves and validates filesystem paths against workspace_root
- calls the GUI approval callback for writes
- creates timestamped backups before approved writes

Modes:
- "single"  — legacy / planner-worker disabled: read + write tools.
- "planner" — read tools + dispatch_to_worker; the planner cannot write.
- "worker"  — read + write tools, no dispatch (workers don't dispatch).
