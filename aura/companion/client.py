"""WebSocket client for Companion — connects to Relay safely from a worker thread.

``CompanionWsClient`` is a thin facade that lives on the UI thread. It owns a
``QThread`` and a separate ``_WsWorker`` QObject (parentless) that is moved into
that thread. The worker runs the asyncio loop. Outbound signals (connected,
disconnected, message_received) use Qt signals from worker→UI thread. Inbound
communication (send, shutdown) uses ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` directly
on the worker's event loop — no Qt queued signals into the worker.
