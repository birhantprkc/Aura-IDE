The candidate directory is: {cand}

Write the following files:
- drone.json — Drone manifest following the DroneDefinition fields from aura/drones/definition.py:
  id, name, description, instructions, write_policy, output_contract, budget,
  entrypoint (dict with kind/command/protocol), route, input_contract, cargo_contract,
  permissions, secrets, dependencies, manifest_version, scope, runtime
- An entrypoint program (e.g. main.py) — a self-contained script that reads JSON from
  stdin, calls an internal run(payload) function, prints JSON to stdout.
- requirements.txt — only if dependencies beyond stdlib are needed.
- Optional README.md.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT call register_drone_folder. Candidate build is NOT installation.
- Do NOT install anything globally.
- Write files inside {cand} using absolute or workspace-relative paths.
- Use "python" as the first entrypoint command element (or "node" for JS).
- The build brief below is the source of truth for what to build.

BUILD BRIEF:
{brief.build_brief}

1. py_compile the entrypoint program if it's Python.
